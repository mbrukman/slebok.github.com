This archive contains 588 grammars in a broad sense.

Each of them has a status of 'extracted' - that is, it has been obtained from some source (usually a tool or a book) with an extractor (an automatic or semi-automatic process). All the metadata is available at the Grammar Zoo itself. All the 'fetched' grammars that served as sources for the extraction, as well as all 'connected' grammars that resulted from analysis and transformation of these 'extracted' ones, are also available at the Grammar Zoo.

This is a snapshot made on 26 November 2014. It is possible that some grammars in this snapshot differ slightly from their current versions. It is also very likely that the current Grammar Zoo contains more entries.

The format is BGF, the BNF-like Grammar Format, which is XML-based and in general not very surprising (terminals, nonterminals, production rules, all such things), its syntax can also be viewed in the Grammar Zoo:
